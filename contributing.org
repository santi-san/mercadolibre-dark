* Getting Involved
Even if you've never contributed to an Open Source project before, I'm always
looking for help identifying missing styles or other issues.

* How to Report Style Issues
** I don't know CSS
If you don't know CSS very well and have found a missing style, please include
as much as possible of following information when opening an issue:

- Screenshot of the problem
- Include the element(s) in the console if at all possible
  - To select an element, target it with your mouse then right-click and choose
    "Inspect Element", otherwise press `Ctrl + Shift + C` and select it with
    your left mouse click
  - Copy the HTML if at all possible

** I know both CSS & GitHub
- *Recommended:* [[#duplicate-the-style][duplicate]] the style.
- Follow the [[#style-guide][style guide]] below
- Make any needed changes, then send us a pull request
- Please include a URL to the page (if public)

*** Duplicate the style or create a "companion style"
When a userstyle is installed from a page, Stylus stores the url of that page
internally along with the CSS style.

If that userstyle is then modified or even renamed, it will still maintain the
original install location, but all automatic updates of the modified userstyle
will be blocked to preserve local changes. A manual update of that userstyle is
required to update, but be warned that an update *will overwrite* all changes,
i.e. *all modifications will be lost*!

To get around this duplicate it.

**** Duplicate the style
The easiest way is to copy and paste the source code into a new, *local* style.

1. Copy the style
    - Open mercadolibre-dark in the [[https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Editor][Stylus' Editor]] [[https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/136959/44433186-de548e80-a56a-11e8-8947-d3331bd6d7a1.png]]
    - Copy the code directly from the edit window.
    - If not all content is automatically selected in the popped up window, use Select All (@@html:<kbd>@@Ctrl@@html:</kbd>@@+@@html:<kbd>@@A@@html:</kbd>@@), then Copy (@@html:<kbd>@@Ctrl@@html:</kbd>@@+@@html:<kbd>@@C@@html:</kbd>@@) the style.
2. Paste into a new style
    - Click "Write new style" in the [[https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Manager][Stylus' Manager]] [[https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/136959/44433186-de548e80-a56a-11e8-8947-d3331bd6d7a1.png]]
    - Paste (@@html:<kbd>@@Ctrl@@html:</kbd>@@+@@html:<kbd>@@V@@html:</kbd>@@) the style into the code block area.
    - Give the style a name, then save.


* Getting Started
** Style guide

- Don't create a new line, if it's background, text, link or border you will find it, just add a =comma= before the ={= and put the =new_element= after. 
  #+BEGIN_SRC css
  /* good */
    element, new_element { 
        property: value;
    }
  /* bad */
    element { 
        property: value;
    }
    new_element { 
        same-property: same-value;
    }
  #+END_SRC


- If you want to add a new userstyle variable/feature, please open an issue and
  discuss it with us first.
- Don't include version bumps with your contribution, all releases are handled
  internally.
- If your pull request (PR) fixes an open issue or replaces another PR, include
  fixes/closes =#issue-number= in your commit message title. [[https://help.github.com/en/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords][Read more on this]]

** Testing changes of a local userstyle
- Open the =mercadolibre-dark.user.css= file in your browser, and make sure to have "live
  preview" checked for testing
  - If you're using a Chromium-based browser, go to /extensions/, open /details/ for
    Stylus, and enable "Allow access to file URLs".
- Make some changes then save the file, and Stylus will do its magic.
